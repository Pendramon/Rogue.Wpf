# Rogue.Wpf
I use this project as a boilerplate for most of my WPF applications.  
The design is inspired by Visual Studio or in other words i was staring blankly at visual studio unable to think of a design until i decided to just copy visual studio's design.  
It is still a **work in progress** got a lot of things i need to clean up and tons of necessary stuff that i need to add, finding time to do so lately has proven to be a challenge.  

Todo:  
Clean up code  
Add logging  
Create styles for controls  
Decouple the main window to allow for multiple same style windows (keeping it DRY)  
Finish the Theme Editor  
And a lot more that i don't have time to do right now including unit tests...
